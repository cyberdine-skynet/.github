Introduction

Welcome to my homelab repositoryâ€”your go-to place for all configurations, documentation, and setup scripts.

As a Cloud Native Engineer, I spend my days working with Kubernetes, and this homelab is my personal sandbox. Itâ€™s where I:
	â€¢	Experiment boldly with new tools, architectures, and practices
	â€¢	Own it end-to-endâ€”from provisioning servers to securing, scaling, and backing them up
	â€¢	Master infrastructure concepts like GitOps, CI/CD, and automation in a low-pressure, self-hosted environment

Every update here is a deliberate step toward deeper understanding and better self-reliance in deploying and maintaining cloud-native systems.

ðŸ“Œ What youâ€™ll find
	â€¢	Declarative infrastructure configs (Talos, Kubernetes, networking)
	â€¢	GitOps workflows for application delivery
	â€¢	Self-hosted setups for backups, monitoring, security, and more

Let me know if this strikes the right balance or if you want a version thatâ€™s shorter, more casual, or polished in another style!
